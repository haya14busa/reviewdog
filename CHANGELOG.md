## [v0.10.0] - 2020-05-07

### :sparkles: Release Note

With v0.10.0 release, now reviewdog can find issues outside diff by controlling
filtering behavior with `-filter-mode`. Also, you can ensure to check reported
results by exit 1 with `-fail-on-error`.

Example
```shell
$ cd subdir/ && reviewdog -filter-mode=file -fail-on-error -reporter=github-pr-review
```

### :rocket: Enhancements
- [#446](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/446)
  Added `-fail-on-error` flag
  ([document](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/tree/e359505275143ec85e9b114fc1ab4a4e91d04fb5#exit-codes))
  and improved exit code handling. ([@DmitryLanda](https://github.com/DmitryLanda), [@haya14busa])
- [#187](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/187)
  Added `-filter-mode` flag [`added`, `diff_context`, `file`, `nofilter`]
  ([document](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/tree/e359505275143ec85e9b114fc1ab4a4e91d04fb5#filter-mode))
  which controls how reviewdog filter results. ([@Le6ow5k1](https://github.com/Le6ow5k1), [@haya14busa])
- [#69](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/69) Support gerrit! ([@staticmukesh](https://github.com/staticmukesh))
- [#548](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/548) Introduced nightly release ([reviewdog/nightly](https://github.com/reviewdog/nightly)). ([@haya14busa])

### :bug: Fixes
- [#461](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/461) All reporters now supports sub-directory run. ([@haya14busa])

### :rotating_light: Breaking changes

  need to use `-filter-mode=nofilter` to keep the same bahavior.
